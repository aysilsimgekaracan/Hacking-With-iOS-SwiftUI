## Project 3: Views and Modifiers
Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.|  Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage() view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had. |  Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

## Project 4: BetterRest
<details>
  <summary>Challenges</summary>
  <li>Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section.</li>
  <li>Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.</li>
  <li>Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.</li>

## Project 5: Word Scramble
<details>
  <summary>Challenges</summary>
  <li>Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.</li>
  <li>Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.</li>
  <li>Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.</li>

## Project 6: Animation
<details>
  <summary>Challenges</summary>
  <li>When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.</li>
  <li>Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.</li>
  <li>Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!</li>

## Project 7: iExpense
<details>
  <summary>Challenges</summary>
  <li>Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.</li>
  <li>Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.</li>
  <li>For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!</li>
